* Which is Easier for TDD?

** Functional Programming wins because:

- *Pure functions* are naturally testable
- *No hidden state* to worry about
- *Predictable outputs* for same inputs
- *Easy to reason about* what to test

** But OOP can be TDD-friendly when:

- Objects have *clear responsibilities*
- *Dependencies are injected*
- *Methods are focused* on single behaviors
