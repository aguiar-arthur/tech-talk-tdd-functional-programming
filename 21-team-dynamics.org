* Working Together with TDD

TDD naturally enhances team collaboration in several ways.
When pair programming, the navigator focuses on writing tests while thinking ahead about requirements
and edge cases, while the driver implements the immediate solution. *(ping-pong)*

** Key collaboration benefits:

- *Pair programming:* Navigator writes tests, driver implements, roles switch naturally
- *Code reviews:* Focus shifts from "Does it work?" to "Are requirements clear?"
- *Onboarding:* Tests become living documentation for new team members
