* I've said the word AI, now I need to talk about AI

Yes, you can use AI to do TDD. AI alone does not do good unit tests - it tends to be repetitive
and the business logic is not highlighted.

So do that same happy path you already do in manual programming: small steps proving to yourself you know the rules,
and yelling at the machine to do proper naming.

** A nice thing to do
If you use any AI-first IDE, create a rule file with the TDD flow you want the machine to follow.
