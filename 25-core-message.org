* The Core Message

TDD isn't about testing - it's about *thinking before coding*.

When you write tests first, you're forced to clarify what success looks like before you build anything.
This simple shift transforms how you approach problems, reduces miscommunication bugs, and builds confidence in your code.

** Remember:
- *TDD = Test-Driven Development* - broader than just implementation
- *Focus on behavior* - not implementation details

*The goal isn't perfect TDD adoption overnight. It's building better software through clearer thinking.*
