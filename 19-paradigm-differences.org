* Key Differences in Practice

** OOP TDD:

- Mock collaborating objects
- Test object behavior
- Setup/teardown object state
- Focus on "what the object does"

** Functional TDD:

- Test pure functions easily
- Mock side effects (IO functions)
- No state setup needed
- Focus on "what the function returns"
