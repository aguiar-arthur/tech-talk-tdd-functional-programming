#+TITLE: How Do We Do TDD?

* Finally, how do we do that

** Giving TDD some properties 

The idea to have properties, is good to define and categorize something.

*** 1
- *You should first write the tests*

*** 2
- *That's it!*

** Development isn't only IMPLEMENTATION

The name is Test Driven Development. *DEVELOPMENT* is broader than *IMPLEMENTATION*.
So the action of writing tests to understand a context that doesn't have unit tests,
or where there's a lack of them, is also TDD.

** But and the rest? 

- *Red, Green, or Yellow* - You don't need that. Why do you need to fail first something that you know will fail? 
- *Baby steps* - You don't need that. Especially if you know the code structure and details.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Simplify TDD to its essence - writing tests first. Don't get bogged down in rigid ceremony.
