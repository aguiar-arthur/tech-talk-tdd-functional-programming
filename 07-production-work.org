* Why we have too much work pushing code to production? 

Since software is SOFT, why don't we just push code directly in production, 
and fix the bugs on the fly? 

** We already do that!

It's obvious that there's a modern happy path to publish code.
- Pair programming
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Manual tests
- Human code review
- AI code review

*** But there's a flow detail

almost every step on that list is just applied *AFTER* you have done
the implementation.
