* "TDD slows down development"

*The myth:* Writing tests first takes longer than just coding the solution.

*The reality:* TDD might slow down your typing speed, but it dramatically speeds up your thinking speed.

When you write tests first, you're forced to clarify requirements,
consider edge cases, and design clean interfaces before getting lost in implementation details.

* "Writing tests first feels unnatural"

*The myth:* You need to know the implementation to write meaningful tests.

*The reality:* If you can't write a test without knowing the implementation,
you probably don't understand the requirements clearly enough to implement it correctly.
