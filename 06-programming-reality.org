* Programming isn't engineering

Our work patterns are defined by the team we're in. We don't have a council of developers
ruling what we should do, based on laws of software implementation. 

** hypothesis 1

So, it's right to affirm that we do whatever we want with our implementation!
(Don't forget that you can be fired)

** hypothesis 2

So, imagine that we have something where we can reproduce behaviors, glue them together,
and if something is wrong, we can reshape that mass of behaviors and fix the errors. 
Even better, this runs virtually in a web of machines around the globe.

*We could call it, SOFTWARE!*
